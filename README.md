Some BASH scripts for those big commands

1. `screenshot.sh`
### dependencies
      `maim`, a `compositor` if you want to see through your selection area, and a notification daemon like `dunst`
also run
      `$ mkdir ~/Pictures/screenshots`
2. `lock.sh`

    **what it does**: takes screenshot, blurs it, and sets it as lockscreen
